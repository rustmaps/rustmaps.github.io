# Getting Started Making Custom Rust Maps

You'll need two things, [Dezinated's Editor](https://github.com/JasonM97/Rust-Map-Editor), and [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta-download).

**Unity Fixes**
  - .NET 4
  - Turn off autobake

**Using MapIO**
  - importing maps
  - importing heightmaps
  - where to get maps to import

**Ground, and Heightmaps**
  - how to select the ground to be able to edit
  - how to use unity's terrain sculpting tools
  - how to get custom brushes

**Textures**
  - how they work
  - how to use them
  - how to blend them

**Topology**
  - changing and painting topology
  - limitations of topology

You can use the [editor on GitHub](./topology.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rustmaps/rustmaps.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
